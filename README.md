# __Compiler_Design__
## Overview
This repository contains the source code of the programs done in our lab using Lex and Yacc. <br> Lexical analysers (.l) files are used to recognise the tokens encountered in a program. <br> Yacc (.y) files are used to design custom grammars for one's own compiler.

## Features
Lexical analysis using Lex <br>
Syntactic analysis and parsing using Yacc <br>
c files & txt files for code input <br>
There are a lot of garbage files which are a result of .y & .l file evaluation

## Usage
It's better to work on a UNIX based OS (Ubuntu / Redhat / CentOS) <br>
Make sure you have Flex (Lex) & Bison (YACC) installed on your system <br>
